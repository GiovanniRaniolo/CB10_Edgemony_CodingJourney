This is a simple React application that allows users to fill out a contact form. The form includes fields for first name, last name, email address, query type, message, and consent checkbox. As the user inputs data into the form fields, the sidebar displays the entered values in real-time.

## Features

- **Last Name**: Input field for user's last name.
- **Email Address**: Input field for user's email address.
- **Query Type**: Radio buttons for selecting the type of query (General Enquiry or Support Request).
- **Message**: Textarea for entering the message.
- **Consent Checkbox**: Checkbox to consent to being contacted by the team.

## Usage

1. **Input Fields**: Fill out the required input fields (First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Query Type, Message).
2. **Consent Checkbox**: Check the consent checkbox if you agree to being contacted.
3. **Sidebar Display**: As you type in the form fields, the sidebar on the right displays the entered values in real-time.
